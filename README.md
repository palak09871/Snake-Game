This project is made using java, for graphics and key events the imports of javax.swing and java.awt are used. the snake increases its length by 1 after eating the apple and new a apple is generated with "random". The edge cases like the head crossing top, left, down, right have been taken care of. The player also loses when the snake overlaps itself. Finally there is a score which is kept in the top center of the panel.
